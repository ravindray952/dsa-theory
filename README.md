The two-pointer method is especially useful when working with sorted sequences because it takes advantage of the sorted order to optimize the solution. It often leads to solutions with a time complexity of O(N) or better, making it a powerful technique in algorithm design. However, it's essential to be cautious about edge cases and handle them properly when implementing two-pointer solutions.
